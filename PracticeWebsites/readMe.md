[Here] is the link to my portfolio of websites I worked on in my class: Communications Lab. The general theme I chose for the website follows the colors and art created throughout the Sudanese revolution. As a Sudanese American myself, I was very close to this revolution and wanted to highlight some of the symbolic pieces that came out of it. The portfolio includes 4 websties focusing on website creation, animation, audio, video, etc. It also includes the docmentation of my process developing these sites.
